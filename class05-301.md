## Thinking in React

#### How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?

The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you’re working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!


- Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the ***single responsibility principle***, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

- The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a ***static*** version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why.

To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.


- To figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:

1- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.

2- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.


-  we’ve identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.
