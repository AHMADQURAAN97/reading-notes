## Java Imports 

 A package name is the same as the folder name which contains the java files and we can declare packages when you define Java program, and the name the packages you want to use from other libraries in an **import** statement.

 and following the optional package declaration, we can have import statements, which allow you to specify classes from other packages that can be referenced without qualifying them with their package.

**Package declaration syntax** in three steps :
1.Package statment (optional).
2.Imports (optional).
3.Class or interface definitions.

**this is Common imports:**
`import java.awt.*;	
import java.awt.event.*;	
import javax.swing.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;	
import java.text.*;	.
import java.util.regex.*;`

## Java Loops 
Java provides different types of loops to fit any programming need. Each loop has its own purpose and a suitable use case to serve.

**types of loops that we can find in Java:**
1.**for loop** : A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

2.Enhanced for-each loop
3.**While loop** :The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.
4.**Do-While loop**:The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
