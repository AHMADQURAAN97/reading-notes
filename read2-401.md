## Java Imports 

### What is import ?

The library it's have packages and classes for that we can import the single class or all the class in the package.

Java give us the feature of pre-built classes and methods that can perform many functions, The classes are grouped in packages that must be imported into your project for using it.

**For example** if we need import this classes from packeges for Regular expression classes we need to use this code:

`import java.util.regex.*;`

 **the package:** that place which it used to group related classes,its contains the .java files and is the same as the folder name that contain java files and we use the name the packages by other libraries in order to using it.

We can using and importing **Package declaration syntax** in three steps :
1.Package statment .
2.Imports.
3.Class or interface definitions.

## Java Loops 
exist different types of loops to fit any programming need. Each loop has its own purpose and a suitable use case to serve.

**types of loops that we can find in Java:**
1.**for loop** :  A for loop it allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter in limited numbers of repeats .
this is example : 

`for (int i =0; i>=; i++) {
System.out.println(i);
}`

2.**for-each loop**:we using it for a certain block of code with the length of the provided array and be in limited terms.


3.**While loop** : we using it for iterates a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean is true and or false and it not limited numbers of repeats.
this is example : 

`while (condition) {
// code 
}`

4.**Do-While loop**: Similar to while with the exception that the code is executed at least once even if the condition is not met.

this is example : 
`do {
// code 
}
while (condition);`
