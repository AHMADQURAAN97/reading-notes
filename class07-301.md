## Who is Roy Fielding?


***Roy Fielding*** : He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world ?

there’s this concept that people are calling “Web Services” or “APIs”. It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?


***HTTP*** : That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

## What does a GET do?
used to request data from a specified resource

## What does a POST do?
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. POST is one of the most common HTTP methods. Some other notes on POST requests: POST requests are never cached.

## What does a PUT do?

PUT method is used to update resource available on the server.

## What does PATCH do?

If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH
