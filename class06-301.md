## Node.js



*Node.js®* is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

***Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine*** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.



- node is a JavaScript runtime it's mean that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. 

- *npm* is a package manager that comes bundled with Node.

- You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing `node -v` and my version of node are running on my machine is `v14.17.1`

- You can check that  npm is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing `npm -v` and my version of node are running on my machine is `6.14.13`

-to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ you need to type this command ; 1- Open your terminal 
2- type the following:

`npm install -g jshint`

- Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.


## Pair Programming 

 *Pair Programming* is Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce

 #### What are the reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

 ##### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

 I think Greater efficiency , Engaged collaboration and Learning from fellow students

#### How does pair programming work?

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
