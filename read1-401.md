# Java Basics

## Variables

 the Java programming language also uses the term "variable" as well. This section discusses this relationship, plus variable naming rules and conventions, basic data types (primitive types, character strings, and arrays), default values, and literals.

What kinds of variables Java programming language ?

1.Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)
2.Class Variables (Static Fields)
3.Local Variables
4.Parameters

Naming

Naming for variables can be summarized as:

- Variable names are case-sensitive. A variable's name can be any legal identifier â€” an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits, beginning with a **letter**, the **dollar sign** "$", or **the underscore character** "_".

- Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters

- If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word

 **The data types supported by the Javaprogramming language are:**

- **byte**: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive)
- **short**: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767
- **int**: By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1
- **long**: The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -263 and a maximum value of 263-1.
- **float**: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification
- **double**: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
- **boolean**: The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false.
- **char**: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character.

### Arrays

An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created,Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index.

Declaring a Variable to Refer to an Array :

`int[] anArray;`

you can declare arrays of other types:

`byte[] anArrayOfBytes;

short[] anArrayOfShorts;

long[] anArrayOfLongs;

float[] anArrayOfFloats;

double[] anArrayOfDoubles;

boolean[] anArrayOfBooleans;

char[] anArrayOfChars;

String[] anArrayOfStrings;`

- create an array of integers
anArray = new int[10]

**The if-then Statement** : The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true.

**The if-then-else Statement** : The if-then-else statement provides a secondary path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to false.

The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true. The if-then-else statement provides a secondary path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to false. Unlike if-then and if-then-else, the switch statement allows for any number of possible execution paths. The while and do-while statements continually execute a block of statements while a particular condition is true. The difference between do-while and while is that do-while evaluates its expression at the bottom of the loop instead of the top. Therefore, the statements within the do block are always executed at least once. The for statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values. It has two forms, one of which was designed for looping through collections and arrays.

## Compile code

takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand (i.e. converts from Java to machine language)
