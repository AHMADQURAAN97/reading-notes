## Java Primitives Vs Objects

### What is java primitive types ?
`boolean`
`byte`
`short, char`
`int, float`
`long, double`

and The reference type is :**Object**

### What deferent between java primitives and Object ?

- **the primitive types** are much faster and require much less memory.
**objects** in Java are slow and have a bigger memory.

### What is autoboxing ?

The process of converting a primitive type to a reference and object contains a single value of the corresponding primitive type.

The memory depends on the number and types of elements of the array.

`Boolean – 128 bits
Byte – 128 bits
Short, Character – 128 bits
Integer, Float – 128 bits
Long, Double – 192 bits`

## Exceptions

**Exception:**  it is thing that happen during the execution of a program that crash the normal flow of instructions.

### What the types of Exceptions ? 

1. the checked exception.
2. the error.
3. the runtime exception.



### Catching and Handling Exceptions


The Attempt-catch is the easier method of handling exceptions. Put the code you want to run in the try block, and any Java exceptions that the code throws are caught by one or more catch blocks.

### Using Scanner to read in a file in Java

The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.

and the scanner provides methods like `hasNextLine()` and `readNextLine()` which can be used to read file line by line. It’s advised to check for next line before reading next the line to avoid NoSuchElementException in Java.
