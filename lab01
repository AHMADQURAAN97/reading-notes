# The Importance of mindest development

A **growth mindset** thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. Out of these two mindsets, which we manifest from a very early age, springs a great deal of our behavior, our relationship with success and failure in both professional and personal contexts, and ultimately our capacity for happiness.

A **fixed mindset** , on the other hand.  assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which we canâ€™t change in any meaningful way, and success is the affirmation of that inherent intelligence, an assessment of how those givens measure up against an equally fixed standard; striving for success and avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being smart or skilled.

And the differences between ***growth mindset*** and ***fixed mindset*** when faced :
```
1. Challenges
2. Obstacles
3. Effort
4. Criticism
5. Success of others
```
