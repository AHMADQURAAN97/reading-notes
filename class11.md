## IMAGES

Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

**Controlling sizes of images in CSS** :
You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

**Aligning images in css**

- ***The float property*** is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image .

- ***New classes*** are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image

Centering images : 
1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.

2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto

#### shorthand background

The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.The properties must be specified in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. background-repeat
4. background-attachment
5. background-position
CSS3 will also support the use of multiple background images by repeating the background shorthand. Because few browsers supported this property at the time of writing, it was not commonly used.
div {
 background:
 url(example-1.jpg)
 top left no-repeat,
 url(example-2.jpg) 
 bottom left no-repeat, 
 url(example-3.jpg) 
 centre top repeat-x;
