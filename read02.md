Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project  called **commit**  Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

**Git** contains :

1. Snapshots
2. Local Operations
3. Tracking Changes
4. Loss of Data
5. States

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions.To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
